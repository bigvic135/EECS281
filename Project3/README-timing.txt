There is one sample log file, and different sets of commands that operate on
that same log file.  The log file and commands were generated by the same
program that generated most of the test cases on the autograder.

All samples were run with a command similar to:

time ./logman sample-log.txt < sample-???-cmds.txt > outfile.txt

The times below are the user time reported for each command file (second line):

d: 0.115
b: 0.111
e: 0.115
t: 0.111
c: 0.113
k: 0.159
q: 0.101 // This time is mostly reading the log file and preparing data structures.
all: 1.077

NOTE: These timings were run on the autograder, which may be faster than the
machine that you are running on.
